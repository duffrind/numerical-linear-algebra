Suggestions for Writing Topics:

- Algorithms to research and implement:
  -- Cholesky Factorization
  -- Gauss-Legendre Quadrature
  -- Conjugate Gradient
  -- Rayleigh Quotient Iteration 
  -- Power Method with shifts and deflation
  -- QR algorithm with Wilkinson shifts
  -- Golub-Kahan bidiagonalization with Householder reflectors
  -- Divide-and-conquer eigenvalue algorithm (Cuppen)
  -- GMRES (generalized minimal residuals)
  -- Sparse NMF
  -- Randomized anything
  -- Feel free to ask me about additional ideas
  
- Implement an algorithm of your choice in PyTorch

- Take an algorithm and use Numba or Cython to speed up.

- Find an interesting paper (related to matrices). Summarize it and implement it.
